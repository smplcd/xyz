    Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm an inhabitant of **Earth**, currently residing in the Frozen Wastelands of North America. My quest is the **understading** of the universe through the mastery of **mathematics** and **computer science**; although I am terrible at both currently.

    I have professional experience in back-end engineering with `.py`, `.docker`, `k8s`, `.sql`, and other back-end stuffs. But don't ask me about those, I don't want to remember.

    Currently reading `kANDr2` to learn `.c`.

            I have spent over 12 hours, trying to make a simple yet refined front end for a compedium of my projects, thoughts, and experiences to no avail. And that's when I serendipitously came across `imml`.

            A no fuss `.md` to `.html` program with a live editor, almost perfect. Sadly there are 2 issues.
            - it's written in the god awful language of `.js` because of the live editor;
            - everything is contained within a single markdown file.
            
            For now this isn't an issue, but once more and more is written, it'll quickly get out of hands and difficult to manage. And I do aim for simplicity after all. There's also a few things I'd like to be different but this is neither here nor there.

            As it stands currently, this is the most styling I'll be bringing to the website. I don't particularly enjoy 'coding' websites, and I have a general distaste for the web in its current incarnation.

            If I don't forget that this exists, there should be updates at least monthly!
